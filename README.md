Generation of synthetic protein sequences using **Protein Language models (pLM)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. This repository includes code for protein sequences retrieval from large datasets (as *Dfam* database for L1 elements), as well as feature ("embeddings") extraction or fine-tuning using **Transformer models**, and visualization using clustering methods (UMAP, t-SNE...) .
